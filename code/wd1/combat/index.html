            <p>All attacks start with the <b>Decleration Phase</b>. The decleration phase begins by the attacker declaring the target for their attack. they can also make it a <em>Team Attack</em> by involving multiple characters. The attacker should <b>commit</b> the participants to make it clear to the defender who is involved. The target can be an opposing <i>conduit</i> or <i>hero</i> in the same lane as the attacking hero(s).</p>
            <p>If the defender has another ready hero in the lane, they may declare a block. The block will change the target of the attack, however as a cost the blocking hero's base damage is reduced to 0 and will become committed.</p>
            <section class="inset">
                  <strong>Due to the cost of blocking, there are a lot of factors to consider when choosing the target and whether to block.</strong>

                <p>Once the <em>participants</em> have been declared the <b>Clash Phase</b> can begin. <i>Clashing</i> means to play a card face down, but remember that clashing is <i>optional</i> - you may choose to play no card.</p>
                    
                <p>When you are clashing with <i>multiple heroes</i> you must also declare which hero is clashing. Any clash effects, shields, etc will be applied to just this hero.</p>
                
                <p>After the Defender plays step the card are revealed and any <i>Clash Effects</i> are applied. Clash effects are written at the bottom of each card and have the <b>Clash</b> keyword.</p>
                <section class="inset">
                  <p>If a card says you can <b>clash again <em>immediately</em></b> it means you can immediately play another card in this combat. Unless the card states otherwise, you will then apply any clash effects and apply its damage and shield values in the next step.</p>
