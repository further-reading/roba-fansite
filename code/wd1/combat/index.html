                <p>All attacks start with the <b>Declaration Phase</b>. This phase begins by the attacker declaring the target for their attack. they can also make it a <em>team attack</em> by involving multiple characters. The attacker should <b>commit</b> the participants to make it clear to the defender who is involved. The target can be an <b>opposing conduit or hero</b> in the same lane as the attacking hero(s).</p>
                <p>If the defender has another ready hero in the lane, they may <b>declare a block</b>. The <b>block</b> will <em>change the target</em> of the attack, however as a cost the <em>blocking hero's</em> base damage is <em>reduced</em> to 0 and will <b>become committed</b>.</p>
                <p class="inset"><strong>Due to the cost of blocking, there are a lot of factors to consider when choosing the target and whether to block.</strong></p>
