                <p>In <i>Radiant: Offline Battle Arena</i> the strategy begins <em>before the first battle</em>. During the <b>setup phase</b> you will be <b>drafting your champions</b> for the game ahead. Here you will have an opportunity to make your ideal composition, or sabotage your opponent's plans to construct theirs. Even if things have not gone your way during the <b>hero draft</b> you will have the opportunity to round out your team with the ideal <b>deity</b> and <b>items</b> to counter your enemy's plans.</p>

                <p>Play order is determined by the flip of a coin. The winner of the flip chooses whether to go first. From this point forward, the first and second players will be referred to as <em>Player A</em> and <em>Player B</em> respectively.</p>
                <p class='inset'><b>Player A</b> will only have <strong>2 action points</strong> in their first turn. Consider the choice to go first carefully. There are both pros and cons for going first in <i>ROBA</i>!</p>

                <p>In this phase players take turns picking <b>champions</b> for their team. Your aim is to both make a <em>synergistic</em> team and to try to counter the synergies in your opponent's team.</p>
                <p>More advanced players may choose to implement <b>bans</b> in their drafts. A <em>banned champion</em> cannot be chosen by either player.</p>

                <p>Once you have drafted three champions each you build your <b>deck</b>. To do this you take the 10 cards for each of your champions and shuffle them together.</p>
                <p class="inset">Your Heroes can use <em>any</em> of your Champion's cards - they are not locked by the source Champion. Take this into account when <b>drafting</b> to build a <em>synergistic</em> team.</p>
                <p class="inset">It is advised that you draft <b>one evoker</b> for the free <b>point of power</b> each turn. It is also advised to draft <em>at least one</em> champion with an <b>attack of 3 or higher</b> to make sure you can easily threaten enemy conduits.</p>
