                        <p>Some <b>heroes</b> have a <b>passive effect</b>, which is printed at the bottom of their card.</p>
                        <p>All <b>mortals</b> also have an associated deck of 10 <b>skill cards</b>. You will shuffle your mortals' skill cards after you <a href='setup#draft'>draft them</a>.</p>

                        <p>Each <b>hero</b> also has a list of <b>keywords</b> printed on their cards. Most of these are just for flavor, except for <em>divine</em> and <em>evoker</em>.</p>

                <p>The play area in <i>ROBA</i> is divided into three <b>lanes</b> which represent paths between opposing <b>conduits</b>.</p>
                <p>Each <b>lane</b> can fit any number of <b>heroes</b>. You can move your <b>heroes</b> between lanes during the <a href="action_phase#move">action phase</a>.</p>
                <p>Some mortals have <b>talent</b> and <b>clash</b> effects on their skill cards that <b>move</b> themselves and/or opposing heroes into <b>different lanes</b>.</p>
                <p><b>Positioning your heroes</b> to defend <em>your conduits</em> and destroy <em>your opponent's</em> is a <strong>key part</strong> of <i>ROBA</i> strategy.</p>
                <p class="inset">Destroying conduits should be a <strong>primary focus</strong> for players. Each ruined conduit gets you closer to <a href="#winning">winning the game</a> and denies your opponent a <a href="end_phase#revive">mass resurrect</a></p>
